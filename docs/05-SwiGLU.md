# SwiGLU
Swish-Gated Linear Unit

Swiglu combines the Swish activation function with a gating mechanism. It introduces both non-linear and smooth gating, allowing the model to retain more nuanced information, especially in large transformer architectures. Swiglu has been shown to enhance the stability and expressiveness of models by improving gradient flow and information retention.

## Equation
GeLU(x)=x⋅Φ(x)

where  Φ(x) represents the cumulative distribution function of a Gaussian distribution.

## Pro's
- Smooth and Controlled Gating: Provides smooth, controlled gating with non-linear behavior, which allows Swiglu to pass small signals without harsh suppression.
- Better Information Retention: The Swish component allows small negative signals to pass through, preventing complete zeroing of negative values, which can help capture subtle patterns.
- Enhanced Gradient Flow: The smooth, continuous gradient helps avoid vanishing gradients, making it ideal for deeper architectures.
- Empirical Gains in Large-Scale Models: Swiglu has been shown to improve performance in state-of-the-art models like Google’s PaLM and LLaMA 3, which require high expressiveness and stability.

## Drawback
More Computationally Intensive: Swiglu requires both the sigmoid and Swish calculations, making it slightly more computationally intensive than GeLU. However, this overhead is usually manageable in large-scale transformer models.

## Typical Use Cases
Swiglu is increasingly used in high-performance transformer models, especially for large-scale architectures such as LLaMA 3 and PaLM, where information retention and gradient stability are critical. Swiglu is particularly well-suited for models that operate over long sequences or require nuanced attention control.

## Plot Analysis
Swiglu’s distinctive curve differs from both GeLU and ReLU:

- Small Positive Output for Negative Inputs: Unlike GeLU, which gently suppresses negative values, Swiglu allows a small positive output for slightly negative values, creating a "bump" in the negative range.

- Gradual Slope and Strong Activation for Positive Inputs: Swiglu gradually rises with positive inputs, providing a smoother and slightly stronger activation than GeLU.

- Non-linear Amplification and Retention: Swiglu’s curve shows non-linear amplification for positive values, making it better suited for capturing complex dependencies, especially in tasks that benefit from subtle data representation.

This unique curve trajectory makes Swiglu a compelling choice for deep transformers, where smooth, nuanced activations help to balance between signal retention and gradient stability. Its ability to pass small negative information while amplifying positive inputs makes it ideal for high-capacity, expressive models.
